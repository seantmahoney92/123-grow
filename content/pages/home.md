      1 2 3 Grow with Me is proud to provide a safe and secure environment for
      your infant to play and grow. Our infant teachers love babies and
      understand their individual needs. 


      Because each infant is on a different schedule, their care is totally as
      unique as they are. Bottles, feedings, and naps are scheduled according to
      arrivals and demands. Diapers are changed on a two hour schedule unless
      warranted more frequently. Our teachers play with the babies working on
      fine and gross motor skills as well as hand/eye coordination. The infants
      are encouraged to explore their environment, develop curiosity and are
      exposed to many age appropriate activities to keep them busy.


      Parent/teacher communication is very important at our center. Informative
      daily sheets are provided for each child. These reflect activities during
      the day such as diaper changes, feedings, and naps. The staff at 1 2 3
      Grow with Me is committed to providing a positive, safe, and loving
      environment, where children can flourish.

      Our toddlers room provides a safe, comfortable area for growing children
      to explore their world. We provide a variety of educational toys which
      children are free to make choices based on development and interest. These
      include puzzles, manipulatives, and art supplies. This is the age where we
      see huge strides in language and motor development. We encourage all
      stages of development while keeping a close eye on the safety and
      well-being of the children.


      Our toddler teachers work alongside parents in helping them raise their
      children through this year of many firsts, so children will have the
      opportunity to learn to their full potential. Informative daily sheets are
      provided for each child. These reflect activities during the day such as
      diaper changes, meals, and daily activities. The staff at 1 2 3 Grow with
      Me is committed to providing a positive, safe, and loving environment
      where children can flourish

      Our in between room follows our thematic and age appropriate curriculum,
      highlighting play-based learning while still providing the safe,
      comforting, family environment they received in the toddler room. In the
      in-between room, teachers encourage self-help skills, social skills, and
      independent thinking through a variety of activities to keep the children
      busy.


      The structure of the in-betweens programâ€™s everyday routine is in place to
      help children feel safe and at ease. The staff at 1 2 3 Grow with Me is
      committed to fostering self-confidence and independence a well-rounded
      child needs in order to be prepared for the preschool years ahead.

      The preschool program at 1 2 3 Grow with Me provides young children with a
      loving, safe, supportive, and caring environment while exposing them to a
      whole new world of physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and language
      development. These children develop a stronger sense of self awareness and
      outside relationships. With our strong emphasis on morals and values, our
      preschool teachers create a warm loving and creative environment where
      students feel secure to explore, learn, and grow.


      In our preschool classroom, the children all learn the important social
      and intellectual skills needed through PLAY. The children are provided
      with many choices with a balance of free play, guided play, and teacher
      directed activities. Our theme based approach exposes the children to a
      large variety of subjects (health, environment, space, weather, and more!)
      giving the children the opportunity to discover new things in different
      ways. Our pre school teachers provide a wonderful foundation of learning
      and discovery that will guide them throughout the rest of their lives.
